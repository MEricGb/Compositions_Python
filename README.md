I have developed a web application that includes a database created using the MySQL database management system. The database contains two tables, Composers and Compositions, which have an M:N relationship. For the backend, I used Flask, while the frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The application allows you to edit the database as you wish, giving you full control over its structure and content.
